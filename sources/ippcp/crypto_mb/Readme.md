# Crypto Multi-buffer Library

Currently, the library provides optimized version of RSA multi-buffer encryption and decryption algorithms based on Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (Intel® AVX-512) integer fused multiply-add (IFMA) operations. This CPU feature is introduced with Intel® Microarchitecture Code Named Ice Lake.

## Multiple Buffers Processing Overview

Some of the cryptography algorithms cannot be parallelized due to their specificity. For example, the RSA algorithm consists of big-number (multi-digit) arithmetic: multi-precision modular multiplications and squaring operations.

Digits of multi-digit numbers are dependent because of carry propagation during arithmetic operations. Therefore, single RSA computation based on general purpose mul/adc instructions is not efficient.

The way to get high-performance implementations of such cryptographic algorithms is a parallel processing using *single instruction, multiple data* (SIMD) architecture. The usage model implies presence of several independent and homogeneous (encryption or decryption) requests for RSA operations, using of SIMD leads to performance improvement.

Multi-buffer processing collects up to eight RSA operations. Each request is computed independently from the others, so it is possible to process several packets at the same time.

This library consists of highly-optimized kernels taking advantage of Intel’s multi-buffer processing and Intel® AVX-512 instruction set.

## Installation

You can install the Crypto Multi-buffer library in two different ways:
1. Installation to the default directories.  
   > **Note**: To run this installation type, you need to have appropriate permissions to write to the installation directory.

   Default locations (default values of `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`):
   - Unix:  /usr/local
   - Windows: C:\Program Files\crypto_mb or C:\Program Files (x86)\crypto_mb
   
   To begin installation, run the command below in the project folder that was specified with `-B`:
   ``` bash
   make install
   ```
   > **Note**: Installation requires write permissions to the build directory to create the installation manifest file. If it is not feasible in your setup, copy the build to the local directory and change permissions accordingly.
   
2. Installation to your own directory.  
   If you want to install the library not by default paths, specify the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable at the configuration step, for example:
   ``` bash
   cmake . -B"../build" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/libcrypto_mb/installation
   ```

You can find the installed files in:

``` bash

├── ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
    ├── include
    |    └── crypto_mb
    │        ├── ed25519_ifma.h
    │        ├── ifma_method.h
    │        ├── rsa_ifma.h
    │        ├── rsa_ifma_cp.h
    │        ├── rsa_ifma_defs.h
    │        └── rsa_ifma_status.h
    └── lib
        └── libcrypto_mb.a
```

## How to Build

You can build the library in two ways:
- Using universal building, which can be used with any target API (in particular, with Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel® IPP) Cryptography\* API)
- Using the OpenSSL\* library

### Universal building

1. Clone the repository from GitHub\* as follows:

   ``` bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/intel/ipp-crypto
   ```
   and navigate to the `sources/ippcp/crypto_mb` folder.
2. Set the environment variables for one of the supported C/C++ compilers.
3. Run CMake on the command line. Use `-B` to specify path to the resulting project and define the variable `-DBN_OPENSSL_DISABLE` to exclude all the OpenSSL dependencies:

   ``` bash
   cmake . -B"../build" -DBN_OPENSSL_DISABLE=TRUE
   ```
4. Go to the project folder that was specified with `-B` and run `make` to build the library  (`crypto_mb` target).

### Building with Intel® IPP Cryptography library

To get access to the optimized kernels through Intel® IPP Cryptography API, build the Intel® IPP Cryptography library as it is described in [Intel IPP Cryptography Build Instructions](../../../BUILD.md). The Crypto IFMA Multi-buffer library will be built automatically if optimization for Intel® Microarchitecture Code Named Ice Lake is available.

### Building with OpenSSL\*

The differences from universal building are:
1. The availability of additional options: `OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR`, `OPENSSL_LIBRARIES` and `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`.  
   Use them to override path to OpenSSL\*:
   ``` bash
   cmake . -B"../build"  
   -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/openssl/include  
   -DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=/path/to/openssl/lib  
   -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/openssl
   ```

2. The availability of tests - `vfy_ifma_rsa_mb` and `vfy_ifma_cp_rsa_mb` targets.

Set `-DOPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE` if static OpenSSL libraries are preferred.

## Usage Examples

You can find the examples of usage of the optimized kernels with Intel IPP Cryptography\* API in the `<ipp-crypto-dir>/examples/rsa_mb` folder.
